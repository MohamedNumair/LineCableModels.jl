## Introduction

Single-core power cables have a complex structure consisting of multiple concentric layers, each with specific geometric and material properties -- for example, a cable of type NA2XS(FL)2Y 18/30 [is shown here](https://www.google.com/search?udm=2&q=%22NA2XS(FL)2Y%2018/30%20kV%20cable%22). Prior to building actual transmission line models that incorporate cables as part of the transmission system, e.g. for EMT simulations, power flow, harmonics, protection studies etc., it is necessary to determine the base (or DC) electrical parameters of the cable itself.

This tutorial covers:

1. Creating a detailed [`CableDesign`](@ref) with all its components.
2. Examining the main electrical parameters (R, L, C) of the cable core [`ConductorGroup`](@ref) and main [`InsulatorGroup`](@ref).
3. Examining the equivalent electromagnetic properties of every [`CableComponent`](@ref) (core, sheath, jacket).
4. Saving the cable design to a [`CablesLibrary`](@ref) for future use.
4. Assigning [`CableDesign`](@ref) objects to a [`LineCableSystem`](@ref) and exporting the model to PSCAD for EMT analysis.

## Cable dimensions

The cable under consideration is a medium-voltage, stranded aluminum conductor cable with XLPE insulation, copper wire concentric screens, water-blocking tape, and PE jacket that is rated for 18/30 kV systems. This information is typically found in the cable datasheet and is fully described in the code type under standards HD 620 10C [CENELEC_HD620_S3_2023](@cite) or DIN VDE 0276-620 [VDE_DIN_VDE_0276_620_2024](@cite):

## Using the cable constructors

!!! note "Object hierarchy"
	The [`LineCableModels.DataModel`](@ref) module implements a carefully designed component hierarchy that mirrors the physical construction of power cables while maintaining the mathematical relationships required for accurate electrical modeling.

### Cable designs

The [`CableDesign`](@ref) object is the main container for all cable components. It encapsulates the entire cable structure and provides methods for calculating global cable properties.

### Cable components

Each [`CableComponent`](@ref) represents a functional group of the cable (core, sheath, armor, outer), organized into a conductor group and an insulator group with their respective effective material properties. This structure is designed to provide precise calculation of electromagnetic parameters.

### Conductor groups

The [`ConductorGroup`](@ref) object serves as a specialized container for organizing [`AbstractConductorPart`](@ref) elements in layers. It calculates equivalent resistance (R) and inductance (L) values for all contained conductive elements, handling the complexity of different geometrical arrangements.

#### AbstractConductorPart implementations

- The [`WireArray`](@ref) object models stranded cores and screens with helical patterns and circular cross-sections.
- The [`Tubular`](@ref) object represents simple tubular conductors with straightforward parameter calculations.
- The [`Strip`](@ref) object models conductor tapes following helical patterns with rectangular cross-sections.

### Insulator groups

The [`InsulatorGroup`](@ref) object organizes [`AbstractInsulatorPart`](@ref) elements in concentric layers, calculating the equivalent capacitance (C) and conductance (G) parameters.

#### AbstractInsulatorPart implementations

- The [`Insulator`](@ref) object represents dielectric layers with very high resistivity.
- The [`Semicon`](@ref) object models semiconducting layers with intermediate resistivity and high permittivity.

!!! note "Equivalent circuit parameters"
	The  hierarchical structure enables accurate calculation of equivalent circuit parameters by:

	1. Computing geometry-specific parameters at the [`AbstractConductorPart`](@ref) and [`AbstractInsulatorPart`](@ref) levels.
	2. Aggregating these into equivalent parameters within [`ConductorGroup`](@ref) and [`InsulatorGroup`](@ref).
	3. Converting the composite structure into an equivalent coaxial model by matching lumped circuit quantities (R, L, C, G) to effective electromagnetic properties (ρ, ε, µ) at the [`CableComponent`](@ref) level. The effective properties are stored in dedicated [`Material`](@ref) objects.

#=
## Core and main insulation

The core consists of a 4-layer AAAC stranded conductor with 61 wires arranged in (1/6/12/18/24) pattern, with respective lay ratios of (15/13.5/12.5/11) [CENELEC50182](@cite). Stranded conductors are modeled using the [`WireArray`](@ref) object, which handles the helical pattern and twisting effects via the [`calc_helical_params`](@ref) method.
=#

# Initialize the conductor object and assign the central wire:
material = get(materials, "aluminum")
core = ConductorGroup(WireArray(0.0, Diameter(d_w), 1, 0.0, material))

#=
!!! tip "Convenience methods"
	The [`add!`](@ref) method internally passes the `radius_ext` of the existing object to the `radius_in` argument of the new conductor. This enables easy stacking of multiple layers without redundancy. Moreover, the [`Diameter`](@ref) method is a convenience function that converts the diameter to radius at the constructor level. This maintains alignment with manufacturer specifications while enabling internal calculations to use radius values directly. This approach eliminates repetitive unit conversions and potential sources of implementation error.
=#

# Add the subsequent layers of wires and inspect the object:
add!(core, WireArray, Diameter(d_w), 6, 15.0, material)
add!(core, WireArray, Diameter(d_w), 12, 13.5, material)
add!(core, WireArray, Diameter(d_w), 18, 12.5, material)
add!(core, WireArray, Diameter(d_w), 24, 11.0, material)

#=
### Inner semiconductor

The inner semiconductor layer ensures uniform electric field distribution between
the conductor and insulation, eliminating air gaps and reducing field concentrations. An optional semiconductive tape is often used to ensure core uniformity and enhanced adherence.
=#

#=
!!! tip "Convenience methods"
	The [`Thickness`](@ref) type is a convenience wrapper that simplifies layer construction. When used in a constructor, it automatically calculates the outer radius by adding the thickness to the inner radius (which is inherited from the previous layer's outer radius).
=#

# Inner semiconductive tape:
material = get(materials, "polyacrylate")
main_insu = InsulatorGroup(Semicon(core, Thickness(t_sct), material))

# Inner semiconductor (1000 Ω.m as per IEC 840):
material = get(materials, "semicon1")
add!(main_insu, Semicon, Thickness(t_sc_in), material)

#=
### Main insulation

XLPE (cross-linked polyethylene) is the standard insulation material for modern
medium and high voltage cables due to its excellent dielectric properties.
=#

# Add the insulation layer:
material = get(materials, "pe")
add!(main_insu, Insulator, Thickness(t_ins), material)

#=
### Outer semiconductor

Similar to the inner semiconductor, the outer semiconductor provides a uniform
transition from insulation to the metallic screen.
=#

# Outer semiconductor (500 Ω.m as per IEC 840):
material = get(materials, "semicon2")
add!(main_insu, Semicon, Thickness(t_sc_out), material)

# Outer semiconductive tape:
material = get(materials, "polyacrylate")
add!(main_insu, Semicon, Thickness(t_sct), material)

# Group core-related components:
core_cc = CableComponent("core", core, main_insu)

#=
With the core parts properly defined, the [`CableDesign`](@ref) object is initialized with nominal data from the datasheet. This includes voltage ratings and reference electrical parameters that will be used to benchmark the design.
=#

# Define the nominal values and instantiate the `CableDesign` with the `core_cc` component:
cable_id = "18kV_1000mm2"
datasheet_info = NominalData(
	designation_code = "NA2XS(FL)2Y",
	U0 = 18.0,                        # Phase-to-ground voltage [kV]
	U = 30.0,                         # Phase-to-phase voltage [kV]
	conductor_cross_section = 1000.0, # [mm²]
	screen_cross_section = 35.0,      # [mm²]
	resistance = 0.0291,              # DC resistance [Ω/km]
	capacitance = 0.39,               # Capacitance [μF/km]
	inductance = 0.3,                 # Inductance in trifoil [mH/km]
)
cable_design = CableDesign(cable_id, core_cc, nominal_data = datasheet_info)

# At this point, it becomes possible to preview the cable design:
plt1, _ = preview(cable_design)
plt1 #hide

#=
### Wire screens

The metallic screen (typically copper) serves multiple purposes:
- Provides a return path for fault currents.
- Ensures radial symmetry of the electric field.
- Acts as electrical shielding.
- Provides mechanical protection.
=#

# Build the wire screens on top of the previous layer:
lay_ratio = 10.0 # typical value for wire screens
material = get(materials, "copper")
screen_con =
	ConductorGroup(WireArray(main_insu, Diameter(d_ws), num_sc_wires, lay_ratio, material))

# Add the equalizing copper tape wrapping the wire screen:
add!(screen_con, Strip, Thickness(t_cut), w_cut, lay_ratio, material)

# Water blocking tape over screen:
material = get(materials, "polyacrylate")
screen_insu = InsulatorGroup(Semicon(screen_con, Thickness(t_wbt), material))

# Group sheath components and assign to design:
sheath_cc = CableComponent("sheath", screen_con, screen_insu)
add!(cable_design, sheath_cc)

# Examine the newly added components:
plt2, _ = preview(cable_design)
plt2 #hide

#=
### Outer jacket components

Modern cables often include an aluminum tape as moisture barrier
and PE (polyethylene) outer jacket for mechanical protection.
=#

# Add the aluminum foil (moisture barrier):
material = get(materials, "aluminum")
jacket_con = ConductorGroup(Tubular(screen_insu, Thickness(t_alt), material))

# PE layer after aluminum foil:
material = get(materials, "pe")
jacket_insu = InsulatorGroup(Insulator(jacket_con, Thickness(t_pet), material))

# PE jacket (outer mechanical protection):
material = get(materials, "pe")
add!(jacket_insu, Insulator, Thickness(t_jac), material)

#=
!!! tip "Convenience methods"
	To facilitate data entry, it is possible to call the [`add!`](@ref) method directly on the [`ConductorGroup`](@ref) and [`InsulatorGroup`](@ref) constituents of the component to include, without instantiating the [`CableComponent`](@ref) first.
=#

# Assign the jacket parts directly to the design:
add!(cable_design, "jacket", jacket_con, jacket_insu)

# Inspect the finished cable design:
plt3, _ = preview(cable_design)
plt3 #hide

#=
## Examining the cable parameters (RLC)

In this section, the cable design is examined and the calculated parameters are compared with datasheet values. [`LineCableModels.jl`](@ref) provides methods to analyze the design in different levels of detail.
=#

# Compare with datasheet information (R, L, C values):
core_df = DataFrame(cable_design, :baseparams)

# Obtain the equivalent electromagnetic properties of the cable:
components_df = DataFrame(cable_design, :components)

# Get detailed description of all cable parts:
detailed_df = DataFrame(cable_design, :detailed)

#=
## Saving the cable design

!!! note "Cables library"
	Designs can be saved to a library for future use. The [`CablesLibrary`](@ref) is a container for storing multiple cable designs, allowing for easy access and reuse in different projects.  Library management is performed using the [`DataFrame`](@ref), [`add!`](@ref), and [`save`](@ref) functions.
=#

# Store the cable design and inspect the library contents:
library = CablesLibrary()
add!(library, cable_design)
library_df = DataFrame(library)

# Save to file for later use:
output_file = fullfile("cables_library.json")
save(library, file_name = output_file);


#=
### Defining a cable system

!!! note "Cable systems"
	A cable system is a collection of cables with defined positions, length and environmental characteristics. The [`LineCableSystem`](@ref) object is the main container for all cable systems, and it allows the definition of multiple cables in different configurations (e.g., trifoil, flat etc.). This object is the entry point for all system-related calculations and analyses.
=#

#=
### Earth model 

The earth return path significantly affects cable impedance calculations and needs to be properly modeled. In this tutorial, only a basic model with typical soil properties is defined. This will be further elaborated in the subsequent tutorials.
=#

# Define a frequency-dependent earth model (1 Hz to 1 MHz):
f = 10.0 .^ range(0, stop = 6, length = 10)  # Frequency range
earth_params = EarthModel(f, 100.0, 10.0, 1.0)  # 100 Ω·m resistivity, εr=10, μr=1

# Earth model base (DC) properties:
earthmodel_df = DataFrame(earth_params)

#=
### Three-phase system in trifoil configuration

This section ilustrates the construction of a cable system with three identical cables arranged in a trifoil formation.
=#


# Define system center point (underground at 1 m depth) and the trifoil positions
x0, y0 = 0.0, -1.0
xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc = trifoil_formation(x0, y0, 0.035);

# Initialize the `LineCableSystem` with the first cable (phase A):
cablepos = CablePosition(cable_design, xa, ya,
	Dict("core" => 1, "sheath" => 0, "jacket" => 0))
cable_system = LineCableSystem("18kV_1000mm2_trifoil", 1000.0, cablepos)

# Add remaining cables (phases B and C):
add!(cable_system, cable_design, xb, yb,
	Dict("core" => 2, "sheath" => 0, "jacket" => 0))
add!(cable_system, cable_design, xc, yc,
	Dict("core" => 3, "sheath" => 0, "jacket" => 0))

#=
!!! note "Phase mapping"
	The [`add!`](@ref) function allows the specification of phase mapping for each cable. The `Dict` argument maps the cable components to their respective phases, where `core` is the conductor, `sheath` is the screen, and `jacket` is the outer jacket. The values (1, 2, 3) represent the phase numbers (A, B, C) in this case. Components mapped to phase 0 will be Kron-eliminated (grounded). Components set to the same phase will be bundled into an equivalent phase.
=#

#=
### Cable system preview

In this section the complete three-phase cable system is examined.
=#

# Display system details:
system_df = DataFrame(cable_system)

# Visualize the cross-section of the three-phase system:
plt4, _ = preview(cable_system, earth_model = earth_params, zoom_factor = 2.0)
plt4 #hide

#=
## PSCAD & ATPDraw export

The final step showcases how to export the model for electromagnetic transient simulations in EMT-type software.
=#

# Export to PSCAD input file:
output_file = fullfile("pscad_export.pscx")
export_file = export_data(:pscad, cable_system, earth_params, file_name = output_file);

# Export to ATPDraw project file (XML):
output_file = fullfile("atp_export.xml")
export_file = export_data(:atp, cable_system, earth_params, file_name = output_file);

#=
## Conclusion

This tutorial has demonstrated how to:

1. Create a detailed model of a complex power cable with multiple concentric layers.
2. Calculate and analyze the cable base parameters (R, L, C).
3. Design a three-phase cable system in trifoil arrangement.
4. Export the model for further analysis in specialized software.
